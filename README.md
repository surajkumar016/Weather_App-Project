# Weather_App-Project

This is a real time weather application build using HTML, CSS, Nodejs, Expressjs. It is made in such a way that it can give the temperature of all the city in the world by fetching data from an realtime API which gives information of weather.

To make it more robust HTML is replaced with Handlebars(package of expressjs).
